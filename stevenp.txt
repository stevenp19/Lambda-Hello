Hi my name is Steven Pizarro.

Funny, Serious and Energetic. 

My new found favorite hobby is coding. This is started out as difficult but the more concepts that i grasp the better it gets!
I recently bought a new dog his name is Titus and he is a black pug with an attitude. I am also really into yoga and training,
pushing my body to it's limits!
